# Starlette
FastAPI is a wrapper around Starlette, so it will often be important to understand how Starlette works.

# Containers
Running in containers locally and in cloud simplifies deployment and reduces conflicts

# VSCode debugging
Being able to set breakpoints is pivotal in debugging applications

# FastAPI and Asynchronous code
FastAPI supports async.
You should definitely use async if your code is doing any IO (network calls, database calls, reading/writing to disc)
